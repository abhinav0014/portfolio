Professional Summary


I am a science student with a strong inclination toward programming, system-level understanding, and practical problem solving. I enjoy building things that solve real issues, experimenting with ideas that combine software and hardware, and working collaboratively with people who value learning and impact.


My interests lie in software development, automation concepts, and applied technology. I am currently seeking remote or part-time opportunities, internships, NGO roles, or freelance work where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to learn through hands-on experience.

Projects


TprGng


A collaborative academic support platform


TprGng is a student-focused platform inspired by the idea of Stack Overflow but tailored for academic environments. It aims to allow students and teachers to ask questions, share notes, and collaborate on learning materials in an organized and accessible way.


Key focus areas:
* Peer-to-peer learning
* Knowledge sharing
* Academic collaboration


Status: Conceptual and exploratory (vision-driven)




InTouch


Location-aware device automation system


InTouch is a conceptual automation project designed to control device behavior based on location and context. Using sensors, geofencing, and peer-based connections, the system can automatically switch devices to silent, vibrate, or specific volume levels in places like libraries or meeting halls.


It also includes manual configuration, allowing users to “teach” the system how devices should behave in different areas.


Core ideas:
* Context-aware automation
* Practical use of sensors and geofencing
* Peer-based interaction and control




Status: Visionary / experimental




School Management Website


Freelance project (currently on hold)


A full-stack school website built to manage notices, events, academic calendars, and student admissions. The system includes an admin panel and a structured admission workflow where submitted forms receive priority handling.


Technologies used:
* Django
* HTML
* Tailwind CSS
* SQLite (development)
* PostgreSQL (planned for production)


Status: Technically complete, not deployed due to external constraints
